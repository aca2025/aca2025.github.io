The researches on the solvability conditions and the structural representations of solutions to matrix and tensor equations have been one of the
important topics in algebra for a long time. Nowadays as one important part
of contemporary mathematics, matrix and tensor equations are widely and
heavily used in many areas such as computer vision, data mining, system
and control theory, and information science. No matter concerning the development of matrix and tensor theory or solving practical problems, further
studying on solutions for matrix and tensor equations is essential.

The topics in this special session mainly focus on the solvability conditions, general and numeric solutions, structural representations and extremal
ranks of the solutions to some matrix and tensor algebraic equations and coupled generalized Sylvester matrix (tensor) equations over various algebraic
structures including fields, quaternions and general rings. Moreover, we will
explore efficient symbolic and numeric computing algorithms for finding solutions and their applications in image processing, system and control theory,
etc.


This special session will be an important opportunity for experts in linear algebra, matrix and tensor theory, ring theory and computer science to
exchange ideas, problems and work together.
