It is well-known that to answer a question, one must first state and formulate it properly. Many questions, from the effect of a drug on cancer cells to the spread of an epidemic, require mathematical modeling. Every project in the life sciences involves chemical materials, cells, or animals, with the ultimate goal of understanding how changes in the quantity of one element affect the others. While some questions can be addressed using basic methods, most require more sophisticated techniques. For instance, when measuring all relevant quantities is impossible, one encounters the issue of identifiability: is it possible to estimate the model's parameters using data from only the observable variables?
<br>

Computer Algebra, as the name suggests, is the field focused on developing algorithms for symbolic computations involving variables and parameters. While life scientists have a wealth of mathematically interesting questions, computer algebra researchers possess a wealth of algorithms and methods capable of addressing complex problems. Our session aims to bring these two groups together and facilitate the matching of questions with solutions. In addition to speakers from previous editions of CASinLife, who will report on collaborations sparked earlier, we are also seeking new participants with fresh challenges and ideas to join our ongoing journey of discovery.

<br>
This will be the fourth edition of CASinLife. The first three editions were held as special sessions of ACA 2022 (in Turkey), ACA 2023 (in Poland), and ICMS 2024 (in the UK). Topics of interests include, but are not limited to the following:
- Mathematical modelling for biological/chemical/ecological questions
- Chemical reaction network theory
- Combinatorial optimizations and machine learning tools for mathematical biology
- Cylindrical algebraic decomposition
- Quantifier elimination theory
- Computer algebra packages for real algebraic geometry
- Parameter identifiability analysis
-Phylogenetics
