What is known as sparse interpolation in computer algebra, is called exponential analysis in digital signal processing. A basic algorithm to solve the former is the Ben-Or/Tiwari algorithm, while the latter problem is often reformulated as a matrix pencil problem. In the past 10 years, the cross fertilization of properties and algorithms has led to progress in both worlds. 

In this special session we discuss some results obtained in real-life applications, as a result of the connection between sparse interpolation and exponential analysis. Among others we mention:
* Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) and Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) in biomedical engineering,
* Operational Deposit Modelling in finance,
* Uniform Linear Array sparsification and synthesis in antenna engineering,
* Superresolution and Validation in digital signal processing,
* Curve generation in Computer Aided Design (CAD),
* Modelling of key performance metrics for reflector antennas in radioastronomy.
