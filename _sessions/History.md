The ACA conference is now 30 years old. The discipline of computer algebra (and
symbolic computation) is considerably older: its roots are really lost to history, if we include
the Antikythera Mechanism. That amazing instrument, surely the oldest analogue computer
known, was found in 1901 not so very far from the location of this conference.
This broad session is not so ambitious as to want to trace all the prehistory of computer
algebra, but we do want to capture as much of that history as resides in living memory and
in publications since the advent of digital computers. This session could include discussion
of the history of the following topics:
* The development of programming languages for computer algebra, e.g. CAMAL and
FORMAC
* Applications of computer algebra and symbolic computation, e.g. celestial mechanics
and perturbation methods
* Algebraic algorithms such as the Buchberger algorithm
* Foundational algorithms (e.g. Berlekamp’s algorithm, or modular methods)
* We informally refer to these topics as being of the heritage of Turing, of Laplace, of
Hilbert, and of Tarski.

<br><br>
We define computer algebra and symbolic computation quite broadly and more by exam-
ple than by precept: we take, for instance, anything that is the subject of an ISSAC paper or
a SIGSAM Bulletin/Communications on Computer Algebra paper or a Journal of Symbolic
Computation paper to be “fair game.” This is already extremely broad. Finally, although
numerals are also symbols, we exclude the history of numerical methods from discussion
except insofar as it pertains to exact computation.

<br><br>
There is a recent thorough history of numerical linear algebra by Brezinski, Meurant,
and Redivo-Zaglia available from SIAM Books. We hope by this session to spark discussion
that leads to a similar volume but for computer algebra and symbolic computation. We
hope that each of the speakers at the session at ACA goes on to write a chapter of that
future book.
