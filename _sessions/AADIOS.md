The algebraic/symbolic treatment of differential equations is a flourishing field, branching out in a variety of subfields committed to different approaches. In this session, we want to give special emphasis to the operator perspective of both the underlying differential operators and various associated integral operators.

In particular, we invite contributions in line with the following topics:

* Symbolic Computation for Operator Algebras
* Factorization of Differential/Integral Operators
* Linear Boundary Problems and Green’s Operators
* Initial Value Problems for Differential Equations
* Symbolic Integration and Differential Galois Theory
* Symbolic Operator Calculi
* Algorithmic D-Module Theory
* Rota-Baxter Algebra
* Differential Algebra
* Discrete Analogs of the above
* Software Aspects of the above

If you are interested in joining the session, please contact us.
