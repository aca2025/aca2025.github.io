One of the key advantages of computer algebra and symbolic computation is
the mathematical exactness of all computed results.  This session concerns
a similar goal of exact mathematical computations for objects of a more
analytic nature, through numerical approximations with provable error bounds.
One particularly important application concerns the reliable integration of
differential equations and the reliable evaluation of special functions.
More generally, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Logical foundations of reliable computation.
- Interval and ball arithmetic.
- High performance implementations of reliable algorithms.
- Reliable evaluation of special functions.
- Reliable integration of dynamical systems.
- Reliable homotopy continuation.
- Effective computations with analytic functions.
- Other applications of reliable computation.
- Mathematical software for reliable computations.

We welcome both theoretical and practical contributions as well as
applications.  The scope is wide and intended to encourage discussions
and new collaborations during the conference.
