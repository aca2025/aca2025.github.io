Noncommutative formal series are considered a successful generalization of language theory in theoretical computer science. 
The combinatorics of these series is based on that of words, and these two fields reinforce each other. 
They form an ideal framework for developing software based on computer algebra systems with rigor and efficiency. 
In particular, they allow the symbolic manipulation of special functions (such as Eulerian functions, hypergeometric functions, hyperlogarithms, harmonic sums, etc.) 
and of special values (such as multiple zeta values, polyzetas, etc.) involved in solutions of differential equations.  

We invite contributions with the following topics: 
* Hopf Algebras and Their Combinatorics
* Ecalle's Mould Calculus
* Free Lie Algebras
* Noncommutative Differential Equations
* Representative Series
