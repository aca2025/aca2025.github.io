Symbolic computation plays an important role in the study of many important
functions and their special values. By constructing noncommutative formal series based
on words using these symbols, one can often discover key properties of these functions
and values in a uniform way. On the other hand, noncommutative formal series can be
considered as a generalization of language theory in theoretical computer science. As the
algorithms and combinatorics of these series is based on those of words, these two fields
naturally reinforce each other. They form an ideal framework for developing software
based on computer algebra systems with rigor and efficiency. In particular, they allow
the symbolic manipulation of several classes of special functions (such as Eulerian
functions, hypergeometric functions, hyperlogarithms, harmonic sums, etc.) and of
special values involved in solutions of differential equations.
We invite contributions with the following topics:
* Combinatorial Indexing and Calculus
* Ecalle's Mould Calculus
* Free Lie Algebras
* Hopf Algebras and Their Combinatorics
* Noncommutative Differential Equations
* Multiple Zeta Values (or Zeta Polymorphism) and Polylogarithms
* Representative Series (Sweedler's duals and their combinatorics)
