Education has become one of the fastest growing application areas for computers in general and computer algebra in particular. Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and Dynamical Geometry Systems (DGS) make for powerful teaching and learning tools within mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, etc. Among them are:
(a) commercial "heavy weights" such as Casio ClassPad 330, Magma, Maple, Mathematica, MuPAD, TI NSpire CAS, and
(b) free software/open source systems such as Axiom, Desmos, Euler, Fermat, wxMaxima, Reduce, and rising stars such as GeoGebra, SageMath, SymPy and Xcas (the swiss knife for mathematics), not to mention systems like Derive (discontinued commercially since 2007) and the essential WolframAlpha, which are important resources for users of symbolic systems.

The goal of this session is to exchange ideas, discuss classroom experiences, and to explore significant issues relating to CAS tools/use within education. Subjects of interest for this session will include new CAS-based teaching/learning strategies, curriculum changes, new support materials, assessment practices from all scientific fields, and experiences of joint use of applied mathematics and CAS including dynamic geometry.

Generative Artificial Intelligence has entered the world very strongly. The Education community has begun to explore the pros and cons of this new technology. We also welcome experiments and research about its usage, either alone or in collaboration with CAS and DGS.

We emphasize that all levels of education are welcome, from high school to university, and that all domains are welcome, including teacher training, engineer training, etc.
