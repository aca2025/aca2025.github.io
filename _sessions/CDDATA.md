Objectives:
----------
Algebraic differential and difference equations and systems of such equations arise in many
areas of mathematics and in a wide range of subject areas including physics, biology, chemistry,
economics, and engineering. Differential and difference computer algebra concerns the study of
systems of differential and difference equations in a constructive way that extends methods and
algorithms of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The main goal of the session is to
discuss recent developments in computational methods of differential and difference algebra, as
well as to explore new ideas and approaches oriented toward various applications of these
methods.


Topics of the session include, but are not limited to:
