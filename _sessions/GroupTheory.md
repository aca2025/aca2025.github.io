 Groups are among the most fundamental objects of study in algebra. They appear naturally in the study of symmetries, but their nature is quite abstract. Representation theory allows us to study such abstract structures with the use of tools from linear algebra.  For the study of concrete examples, computer algebra is extremely useful and many computer packages have been developed for this reason (including, but not limited to, GAP, Magma, Maple, SageMath). Moreover, there are families of finite groups, such as the sporadic simple groups or the exceptional complex reflection groups, for which most theoretical results have computational proofs. Finally, there are many discussions nowadays about the possibility of obtaining proofs to major open conjectures, as well as new theorems, with the use of computers. The session “Computer algebra in representation theory” will aim to cover all the topics mentioned above, with talks from researchers in group or representation theory who use or develop computer algebra tools.
