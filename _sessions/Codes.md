This special session will focus on the interplay between coding theory with special emphasis on algebraic, combinatorial, and computational methods. These include the exploration of algebraic and geometric methods for special classes of codes such as algebraic geometry codes, rank-metric codes, additive codes, and codes with automorphisms. Techniques from Delsarte and Levenshtein for code families and related combinatorial structures will also be explored. Additionally, the session will focus on computer algebra methods for determining the parameters of codes and related combinatorial structures.
