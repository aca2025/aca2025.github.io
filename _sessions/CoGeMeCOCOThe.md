The theory of error-correcting codes has inspired many mathematicians who were interested
in applying techniques from algebra and discrete mathematics in order to progress on
questions in information processing.
Coding theory lies at the intersection of several
disciplines in pure and applied mathematics such as algebra, number theory, probability
theory, statistics, combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistical physics, which all have
helped in the past to increase our knowledge in communication theory. The design of
error-correcting codes for the reliable transmission of information across noisy channels
plays a crucial role in the modern era due to the massive overall communication traffic. To
this aim, it has been necessary to develop sophisticated algebraic, combinatorial and
geometric tools in order to construct codes that can correct as many errors as possible in a
very efficient way.


This session is focused on the application of computer algebra to coding theory which,
together with classical and new methods from combinatorics and geometry, can be used to
obtain several and important results, such as construction of optimal codes, definition of
efficient encoding and decoding algorithms and the study of algebraic, geometric and
combinatorial problems arising from practical problems in coding theory.
We wish to invite talks about recent results and developments in coding theory, including but
not restricted to:

* Algebraic coding theory
* Rank/sum-rank metric codes
* Algebraic geometry codes
* Graph theory methods in coding theory
* Convolutional codes
* Quantum codes
* Algebraic decoding algorithms
* Combinatorial algorithms
* Computational results
* Related algebraic and combinatorial structures
