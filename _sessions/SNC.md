The integration of symbolic and numeric techniques has become increasingly important in various fields of computational science and engineering. Symbolic-numeric computation (SNC) combines the power of exact symbolic manipulation with the efficiency of numerical methods, addressing complex problems that require both precision and computational scalability. This session aims to highlight the latest developments and applications of SNC, including hybrid algorithms, efficient implementations, and interdisciplinary uses. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms for solving equations
- Exact and approximate solutions in algebraic geometry
- Symbolic differentiation and numerical integration
- Symbolic-numeric methods for large-scale linear and nonlinear systems
- Applications in data science, machine learning, and optimization
- Symbolic-numeric approaches to differential equations and systems
- Tools, software, and frameworks supporting SNC

This session welcomes contributions that integrate symbolic and numeric techniques, focus on innovative methods, theoretical advancements, and practical applications. By bringing together researchers from diverse fields, we aim to encourage discussions on the challenges and opportunities in hybrid computation. We invite both theoretical and applied work, including novel algorithmic developments, computational frameworks, and real-world problem-solving approaches that leverage the strengths of both symbolic and numeric computation.
