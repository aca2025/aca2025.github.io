The progressive impact of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) in science-based disciplines is vividly
noticeable. It is rare to encounter a scientific investigation immune from its beneficial influences.
Within 30 years, the CAS has become an efficient tool for analyzing engineering and mathematical
challenges. Symbolic capabilities of the CAS provide a forum to perform amazing calculations that
practically are impossible otherwise. For instance, dynamic simulations of engineering issues are
addressed, and mathematical conjectures are formulated and verified. Many problems in physics
and mechanics are tackled by applying the perturbation theory, which implies that quite
cumbersome symbolic calculations can be solved efficiently with the CAS.

The purpose of organizing this session is to bring together enthusiastic users of Computer Algebra
Systems in science and engineering. Expected topics of presentations include (but are not limited
to):
* symbolic and numerical methods for solving ODEs
* modeling and simulation in physics and engineering
* applications in classical and celestial mechanics
* perturbation theories
