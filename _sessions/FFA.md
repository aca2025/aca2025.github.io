This session's focus is on the rich and diverse world of finite
fields which play a crucial role in various branches of mathematics
like algebra, number theory, combinatorics, finite geometry and more.

Finite fields also provide the foundation for many aspects of secure
and robust communications in applied areas such as coding theory,
cryptography, and information theory.

We aim to bring together a group of researchers to discuss and
showcase the latest advancements in the theory, applications and
implementations of finite fields.
