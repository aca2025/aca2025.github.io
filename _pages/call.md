Call for Sessions
---

The ACA conferences are organized as a series of Special Sessions. 
All interested session organizers can propose a Special Session by sending an e-mail to the 
ACA 2025 Organizing Committee, namely George Kapetanakis and Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos (Program Chairs), 
and Eleni Tzanaki (General Chair). 
The ACA Working Group will then decide on the acceptance of the proposed session. 
All accepted sessions will be immediately announced on the conference website.


Session organizers are expected to prepare webpages to host the information regarding their special sessions. 
Links to the special session webpages will be provided on the ACA 2025 webpage.

A proposal for an ACA 2025 Special Session has to include
* title of the Special Session,
* short abstract describing the Special Session,
* contact information of the organizers.
